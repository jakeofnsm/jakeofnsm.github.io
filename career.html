<p>I have been with Cardinal for quite a while now and I don't see any reason for leaving now. I have had an amazing experience with them. Cardinal has helped me grow in my career and challenged me at each stumbling block. They really strive to make sure each of their employees has the tools necessary to do their job and luckily I work at a smaller site that requires me to wear a lot of hats. I have taken the OSHA 30-hour class for general industry, I'm a certified Kaizen leader, I'm level 3 HAZMAT trained and have had the opportunity to travel all over the country to see how the business is run in different markets and different sectors of healthcare.<BR>
