My family unit is comprised of four humans.<BR><BR><B>Clara</B> is the youngest human. She has been on this earth about three years. Clara is very light-hearted and funny. She is outgoing and does not shy away from strangers. She is also quick witted and has some great come backs. Clara knows exactly what she wants and it only takes her about 5 seconds to decide on things like dinner or toys at the store. She is not much of an athlete, she is quite clumsy. <BR><B>Wren</B> is the oldest child of the group. She is fiercy and sassy with a bit of a temper, if you push her. She also has a big heart and closely guards her family from ill will! Wren is more reserved and prefers to observe situations before she acts. She is a thoughtful five-year-old and makes cards for everyone she loves almost daily. Wren loves organizing, arts and crafts and any type of competition (especially physical competition!). <BR><B>Holly</B> is the mother and house motivator! When we are all aimlessly wandering around the house, she brings us together and sets us on missions. With a keen eye for decoration, she enjoys organizing, keeping a clean house and making it look beautiful. A teacher by trade, she has gathered a wealth of knowledge in art of getting those around her to do what she wants. She often unleashed these powers on her own family when things are going south. She reads thirty books a year and writes the most beautiful poetry. <BR><B>Jake</B> is the father and cook of the house. He love whipping up comforting dishes that will surely stick to your ribs. He likes to tinker with techie-type stuff and is a decent musician. Jake likes to take his family on vacations and to see new things and experience new experiences. Did you notice? He loves retro gaming and modding old gaming systems!
